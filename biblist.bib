abstract = {CMMI{\textregistered} (Capability Maturity Model{\textregistered} Integration) models are collections of best practices that help organizations to improve their processes. These models are developed by product teams with members from industry, government, and the Carnegie Mellon{\textregistered} Software Engineering Institute (SEI). This model, called CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV), provides a comprehensive integrated set of guidelines for developing products and services.},
